To Understand Apply  Explainable  AI tools.  
 
 
Tool 1: AIX360  
Pre-Processing  
For GLRM predict medical expenses person. So  Medical expenses act 
our Target Variable rest variables act features.  
We split data training testing data.  
 
 
 As seen histogram, conclude Health Expenditure values Right Tailed. 
So know people spend lot healthcare 
labeled “High Cost Patients”.  
 
The distribution long heavy tail consisting high -cost individuals. This manifests 
in  mean five times median , standard deviation three times mean , 
and costly individuals running hundreds thousands dollars.  
 
After spli tting data training testing parts, take categorical features used 
prediction.  
The two algorithms LinRR BRCG (Boolean Rule Column Generator) require non -binary 
features binarized using provided FeatureBinarizer  class. W e list features 
considered categorical, use default 9 quantile thresholds (i.e. 10 bins) binarize ordinal 
(including continuous -valued) features, include negations (e.g. '>' comparisons well '<='), 
and also return stan dardized versions original unbinarized ordinal features, used 
by LinRR BRCG.  
 
 
 
Feature Binarizer: Binarize data (set feature values 0 1) according threshold.  
Values greater threshold map 1, values les equal threshold map 
0. With default threshold 0, positive values map 1. This required step 
estimators use boolean random variables.  
Linear Rule Regression: It regression model uses rule based fea tures, parameters 
as lambda0 lambda1 used penalize number rules used model.  
Baseline:  
 We consider baseline model works complexity. General Gradient 
Boosting Regressor works well prediction continuous values. We use  
data binarized.  
 
The value R^2 Training 51%  value R^2 Testing 13%. There huge 
difference training testing values R2 score. This indicates Overfitting.  
Moreover, R2 score Testing 13% indicates problem complex 
difficult explai n.  
Generalized Linear Rule Models (GLRM)  
We use Linear Rule Regression problem predicting healthcare expenditure

 Abstract  
The provided prolog file Expert System COVID -19 diagnosis. It allows user 
input symptoms, check symptoms, perform temperature check, perform checkup 
diagnose patient COVID -19. The provided  report highlights main predicates  
the program highlights meant  module.  
Aim report provide understanding expert system predicates used 
it. The report two section s, first section contains predicate clauses  code 
snippets provide explanation , second section showcases exploration 
features provide ES .   
The Expert System derived GitHub repository Rojay White , credits 
work goes him. As per instructions mentioned Read.md repository Moh Project

Post making code executable Prolog following 12 predicates identified  
dynamic(symptom/1).  
In Prolog, dynamic/1 Prolog provides powerful mechanism dynamically modifying 
predicate database runtime, useful wide range applications, including 
medical diagnosis systems, expert systems, natural language processing systems.  Its 
intended use program interact assert retract systems. Which would

For example, suppose predicate called symptom/2 represents symptom
